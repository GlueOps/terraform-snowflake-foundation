```sql
CREATE USER backupadmin PASSWORD = <in_pw_manager> DEFAULT_ROLE = PUBLIC
```
2. Grant `ACCOUNTADMIN` role to `backupadmin` user.
```sql
GRANT ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN TO USER backupadmin
```
3. Create `terraform` user with `ACCOUNTADMIN` default role.
```sql
CREATE USER terraform
PASSWORD = <in_pw_manager>
DEFAULT_ROLE = ACCOUNTADMIN
```
4. Grant `ACCOUNTADMIN` role to `terraform` user to manage users
```sql
GRANT ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN TO USER terraform
```

5. Submit an email request to Snowflake to create Snowflake Organization and add accounts to organization.

6. Grant `ORGADMIN` role to `<company_key>admin` and `backupadmin` users
```sql
GRANT ROLE ORGADMIN TO USER <company_key>admin;
GRANT ROLE ORGADMIN TO USER backupadmin;
```
